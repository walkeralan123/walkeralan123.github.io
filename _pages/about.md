Hi there üëãüëã !

My name is Yishuo Cai (Ëî°Ëâ∫Á°ï), I'm currently a senior undergraduate student at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://cse.csu.edu.cn/), [Central South University (CSU)](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) with GPA ranking **1/197**, pursuing a B.E. degree in Software Engineering. Now, I am an incoming Ph.D. candidate at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [**Peking University (PKU)**](https://www.pku.edu.cn/)

Previously, I explored research in multiple areas, particularly in Trustworthy AI, with a focus:

- Evaluation, Safety aspects of large language models (LLMs) (published at *EMNLP'24*) 
- Backdoor attacks in real-world scenarios like model quantization (published at *ICML'24* and *CVPR'24*)

My current research interests focus on Multimodal LLM, Generative AI, etc. **I am eager to conduct impactful research with a broad scope, not limited solely to Trustworthy AI.**

I have won the National Scholarship (0.2% national-wide) **3** times.

üåüüåü I'm currently actively seeking for Research Assistant, or internship positions related to any of the above topics. I'm also open to any possible discussions or collaborate opportunities. please feel free to contact me for further discussion and potential collaboration!
